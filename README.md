# Timekeeper

Timekeeper is an application to help you visualize time across different time zones. Inspired by one of my favorite apps, I decided to develop a web version.

## Features

- View the current time in multiple time zones.
- Add and remove locations easily.
- Change the base time to see the corresponding times in other locations.
- Automatically detects and sets your base location.

## Usage

1. Enter a location (e.g., Los Angeles, CA) in the "Location" input field and click "Add location" to view the current time in that location.
2. Change the base time using the time picker to see the corresponding times in other locations.
3. Use the reset button to clear the time change and view the current times again.
4. Click the delete icon top right on any location to remove it from the list.
